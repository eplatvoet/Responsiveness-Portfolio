# Assignment 2 - Responsiveness Portfolio
This assignment was to create a personal portfolio that was responsive to differing screen sizes. We were required to make an "about me" page, a "contact" page, and a portfolio page.  Other requirements for this assignment were to use bootstrap, ensure all properties catered to differing screen sizes, all links working, use personal information, and having the HTML documents validated.


## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
